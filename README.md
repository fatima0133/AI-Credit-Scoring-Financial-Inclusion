# AI-Powered Credit Scoring for Financial Inclusion

This project proposes an AI-based credit scoring system that uses alternative data such as income patterns and transaction behavior to assess creditworthiness of unbanked individuals. The system classifies applicants into risk levels to support fair and inclusive lending decisions.

This is a conceptual prototype created for hackathon submission.
